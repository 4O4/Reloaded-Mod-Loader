# [Reloaded] Input Stack Configuration
# DInput: Button IDs are mapped onto their respective DirectInput key codes.

# Defines the port that the controller is assigned to.
# By default the loader reads all devices assigned to a port.

[Axis]

# Stores the name of the programmatical property where the axis information is obtained from.
# This allows for the axis to be assigned to any other axis type on an input device, such as
# velocity, torque and other factors of a multi-axis controller.
Left_Stick_X = Null

Right_Stick_X = Null
Right_Stick_Y = Null
Left_Trigger = Null
Right_Trigger = Null

[Axis Type]

# Specifies the default axis types for each axis.
# This is just a leftover from more legacy code and should not be modified by the user.
# I guess you could disable an entire axis with this... if you really w.w.w..w...ant to.
# o.o.o.okay... actually... it's used to remap XInput axis, ahahahah.

[Axis Inverse]

# e.g. You can reverse stick direction.

[Axis Deadzone]

# Deadzone for the axis, between 0 and 100% (float)
# If you don't know what a deadzone is, you should google it.
# In short, the deadzone is an area from the center of the joystick that wouldn't recognize input if the stick is moved within it.

[Radius Scale]

# This is a value which multiplies all axis' analog inputs.
# Setting this above 1 allows for the extension of the radius of an analog stick or trigger.
# This is useful if you want to restrict trigger movement or want to reach all value maximums on each axis.
