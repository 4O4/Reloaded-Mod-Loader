## Modification Structure

At the core, Reloaded Modifications consist of three components:

```
Config.json: Defines the modification properties such as name, description and version.
Banner.png: Preview image for the Reloaded-Launcher.
main32/main64.dll: Used for code mods only. Contains custom C# user code.
```

### Config.json
The typical configuration file is defined in a JSON file as follows, you simply should fill the following fields.
```json
{
	"ModId": "reloaded.global.fileredirector",
	"ModName": "[X86/X64] Reloaded File Redirector",
	"ModDescription": "Redirects loading of game files from your game directory to files inside Plugins/Redirector/ in enabled mod folders.",
	"ModVersion": "1.0.0",
	"ModAuthor": "Sewer56",
	"ModSite": "https://github.com/sewer56lol/Reloaded-Mod-Loader",
	"ModSource": "https://github.com/sewer56lol/Reloaded-Mod-Loader",
	"ConfigurationFile": "",
	"Dependencies": []
}
```

- ModId: Can be any arbitrary piece of text or value, just make it unique. Once set, it should not be changed.

- Dependencies: A list of other mods' Mod IDs that require to be loaded for your mod to function. When set, any dependencies of a mod will always be loaded before the mod itself.

- ConfigurationFile: A name of a file to be opened inside the mod directory when the user selects "Configuration" in Reloaded-Launcher. Can be an executable, ini or any other file kind.

## File Redirection Modifications
Due to Reloaded's quest to modularity, all features that actually do the tampering with games are enabled inside mods rather than at the core with the loader. As such, Reloaded's file redirection capabilities are implemented in a mod itself (which ships with all Reloaded copies) as seen below:

</center>

As such, for file redirection based mods you should specify a dependency on the mod above:
```json
"Dependencies": [ "reloaded.global.fileredirector.new" ]
```
(Originally `reloaded.global.fileredirector`, now replaced with a new implementation)

For files to be loaded by the game with the mod enabled, create the folders`Plugins/Redirector` in your mod directory; i.e. you create the folder `Plugins`, and inside that folder `Redirector` and place your files there.

To be strictly precise, the folder in `Plugins/Redirector` maps to individual game profile's `Game Directory` as seen in the launcher below:

That's all you need to know.

### File Redirection Modifications: Extra Info

Files are not mapped by filename but their location relative to the game folder, thus in this scenario, to replace a music file at `E:/Projects/Sonic Hacking Stuff/SonicHeroes/Game/dvdroot/bgm/SNG_STG26.adx` your mod should place the file at `Plugins/Redirector/dvdroot/bgm/SNG_STG26.adx`.

The reason game directory in Reloaded is a separate field to the executable, path is due to the occasional games that store their executables in subfolders to the game's root directory.

For example Rocket League stores the executable in `Binaries/Win32` relative to the game directory while the files are at `TAGame/CookedPCConsole`. 

It is your job as communities to agree on the folder to use, although in most cases it will be the same folder that contains the executable (auto-filled when adding an executable path in Reloaded-Launcher).

## Building Code/Script based Modifications

See Reloaded for Developers.


## Distributing Modifications
In order to distribute your modifications, you simply make an archive with the directory containing the modification inside, that's all that's required.

Your archive file should look as such:

<center>
	<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6W1O2nq.png" align="center" width="500" />
</center>

*The empty RELOADED file at the archive is not necessary and is ignored by the loader, it is third party specific [GameBanana] (see below).*

### Third Parties
Reloaded-Launcher has a custom URI handler and can download archived mods from the web if they begin with `reloaded:`.

Here is an example (not a real link): `reloaded:https://gamebanana.com/mmdl/example123456`

Formats supported include 7z, RAR and ZIP, among a few others.

### Third Parties: User's End
 
Due to Reloaded's nature of being a universal loader, there is no specific detection of the game title in question. The user is required to themselves explicitly specify the game the mod should be installed to.

### Third Party Specifics:
**GameBanana**

In order to be successfully picked up as a Reloaded mod on the site and gain a 1-click install, include an empty file with no extension named RELOADED at the root of archive.

Should a 1-click install link be still missing after submission, then congratulations! You pioneer are the first to submit a Reloaded mod for a specific game on the site.

Consider contacting a member of the site staff or myself to add the game to Reloaded's game list on the site to enable 1-click Reloaded links for the game. Due to performance reasons, on the site's end, 1-click cannot be added on a site basis and needs to be added on a per-game basis instead as-is.
